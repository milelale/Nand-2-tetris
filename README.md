# This is a github repository following the projects from the "Nand 2 Tetris" book.
It is an interesting challange where you get to create your computer from scratch. You start with simple logic gates building your way up with constructing your ALU, Memory, CPU and then finaly ending up at creating your own Operating system.
I recommend this book to someone who wants to understand computers at a much more foundational level, overall a realy good experience!
